Quiz assignment

-With the intention of utilixzing as much of what I learned at that point in time, I made a Quiz game with several files of HTML, CSS and JS. 
I wanted to try and use several files so i could properly learn to connect them So they would work as a unit. This is a basic Quiz game generally speaking-

Deployed By Github Pages, This Quiz has a Home page, an end page and a High Score page which lead to each other. As you play the game it will take track of your
and save it in local storage so you can save your name with your High Score.
